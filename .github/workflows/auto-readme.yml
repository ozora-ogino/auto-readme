# Project Name

## Description
The 'README Updater Action', a GitHub Action, demonstrates another significant functionality enhancement. This new version uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create and update the README.md file based on changes from Pull Requests. It includes improved logging, exception handling, and the ability to manage large chunks of changes effectively.

## Dependencies
The GitHub Action relies on two core dependencies - PyGithub and OpenAI.

## Features
The feature list now includes:
- **README Auto-Updater Action**: This new GitHub Action retrieves templates from '.github/README_TEMPLATE.md' and updates the README.md file based on Pull Requests.
- **Uses GPT-4 OpenAI Model**: Harnesses the processing power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate meaningful and succinct updates.
- **Pull Request Active**: Works with every new Pull Request, excluding those that only modify the README.md.
- **Automatic Commit & Push**: Automatically commits and pushes alterations to the README.md file.
- **Complete User Customizability**: You can tailor the Python script in the "Update README" step according to your requirements.
- **Exception & Chunk Handling**: Manages large changes and exceptions robustly.

## Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Copy the '.github/workflows/auto-readme.yml' to an identical folder in your repository.
2. Set up the following secrets in your repository's Settings > Secrets > Actions: OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key, and GH_TOKEN with your GitHub Personal Access Token ('repo' scope for private repositories, 'public_repo' for public repositories).
3. Adjust your repository settings in Settings > Actions > General, under "Workflow permissions", to "Read and write permissions" and enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests".

## Usage
This GitHub Action triggers whenever a new Pull Request gets opened or updated, excluding those specific to README.md. All changes are committed and pushed to the README.md file automatically, with the help of the GPT-4 OpenAI model.
 
## Recent Updates
- **New Feature 'README Auto-Updater Action'**: A new GitHub Action has been introduced that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to automatically generate and add updates to the README.md based on changes made in Pull Requests.
