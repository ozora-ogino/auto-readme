# Project Name

## Description
This is a GitHub Action called 'README Updater Action' that updates the README.md file automatically to reflect changes proposed in Pull Requests. Harnessing the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model, this tool can handle large changes and efficiently generate concise and informative updates. Notably, this action triggers on every Pull Request that modifies any file, excluding README.md itself.

## Dependencies
The action depends heavily on PyGithub and OpenAI.

## Features
- **README Auto-Updater Action**: A new GitHub Action that systematically updates the README.md file based on the changes proposed in Pull Requests.
- **Uses GPT-4 OpenAI Model**: Harnesses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate succinct and meaningful updates.
- **Pull Request Active**: Works with every new Pull Request, barring those that only modify README.md.
- **Automatic Commit & Push**: Directly commits and pushes the alterations made to the README.md file.
- **Complete User Customizability**: The Python script in the "Update README" step can be tailored as per your requirements.
- **Exception & Chunk Handling**: Ensures the robust handling of large changes and exception management.

## Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Copy 'auto-readme.yml' to '.github/workflows/update-readme.yml' in your repository.
2. Set up the following secrets in your repository's Settings > Secrets > Actions:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key.
   - GH_TOKEN with your GitHub Personal Access Token ('repo' scope for private repositories, 'public_repo' for public repositories).
3. Adjust your repository settings:
   - In Settings > Actions > General, under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions".
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests".

## Usage
This auto-updater action triggers whenever a Pull Request gets opened or updated, excluding those specific to README.md. All alterations are automatically committed and pushed to the README.md file with the help of the GPT-4 OpenAI model.

## Recent Updates
- **New Feature: README Auto-Updater Action**: We introduce a new GitHub Action - 'README Updater Action', that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to automatically generate and add updates to the README.md based on changes in Pull Requests.

## Contributing
Contributions for improvements to this GitHub action are highly encouraged. You can tailor the Python script in the "Update README" step as per your requirements. Feel free to report issues or submit pull requests to the repository.
