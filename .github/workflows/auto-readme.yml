# README Updater Action
#
# This GitHub Action automatically updates the README.md file based on changes in Pull Requests.
# It uses OpenAI's language models to generate concise and informative updates,
# focusing on critical changes such as workflows, package.json, and application endpoints.
#
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Copy this entire file to .github/workflows/update-readme.yml in your repository.
# 2. Create a .github/README_TEMPLATE.md file in your repository with the structured template.
# 3. Set up the required secrets and variables in your repository:
#    - Go to your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
#    - Add a new repository secret named OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key
#    - Add a new repository secret named GH_TOKEN with a GitHub Personal Access Token
#      (The token should have 'repo' scope for private repositories, or 'public_repo' for public repositories)
# 4. Configure your repository settings:
#    - Go to your repository's Settings > Actions > General
#    - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
#    - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
# 5. Optionally, customize the on: section below to control when this action runs
#
# Note: This action uses a custom GH_TOKEN for authentication instead of the default GITHUB_TOKEN.
#       Make sure to set up the GH_TOKEN secret as described above.

# 3. Verify that the repository settings for Actions are correctly configured as mentioned in the setup instructions
# 4. Check the Action logs for any error messages or unexpected behavior
# 5. Make sure the OPENAI_MODEL variable is set to a valid OpenAI model
